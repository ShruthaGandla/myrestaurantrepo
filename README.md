# myrestaurantrepo
Developed the Restaurant web application by following the principles of MVC architecture and designed the RESTful api. 
I implemented admin only login functionality using Auth0 module and Angular 4 framework. 
I constructed the models and wrote CRUD for Admin and Menu where only Admin is authorized to edit the menu and user is authorized to
view the menu. I built the routes following the principles of Restful architecture and also all the routes are secured.
